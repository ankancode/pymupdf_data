2021 Managing Director Diversity
Citi promotes a new class of Managing Directors (MD) each year. This is the highest officer level at Citi and is a testament to  
these individuals’ performance and commitment to living our Leadership Principles —Taking Ownership, Delivering With Pride  
and Succeeding Together — and instilling them throughout their teams and the entire firm.
For our 2021 class, we promoted 306 MDs, who are based in 30 countries and represent one of the largest and most diverse  
classes in recent years.
