Citi	Impact	Fund
The Citi Impact Fund is a $200 
million venture capital fund with 
a mission of investing in “double 
bottom line” companies that are 
addressing societal challenges, 
such as reaching low- and 
moderate-income households with 
innovative financial and workforce 
services, delivering solutions for 
the climate transition economy, 
and addressing needs for inclusive 
healthcare and housing. 
Venture	capital	funding	has	historically	
been	inaccessible	to	most	start-up	found-
ers,	but	especially	so	for	women	and	
people	of	color.
The	fund,	which	at	its	founding	in	2020	
was	the	largest	impact	fund	ever	launched	
by	a	bank	using	its	own	capital,	focuses	
on	companies	that	are	led	or	owned	by	
women	or	racial/ethnic	minorities.	We	
started	the	fund	with	$150	million	in	
January	2020,	adding	another	$50	million	
specifically	to	support	businesses	owned	
by	Black	entrepreneurs	as	part	of	Action 
for Racial Equity.
