Citi Bike Program 
The Citi Bike® program has been one of our longest-running and largest-scale efforts to enhance urban quality of 
life. In New York City, where transportation is the second-largest driver of greenhouse gas emissions, the program 
has reduced an estimated 130,000 tons of CO2e emissions* — or the equivalent of removing 30,000 vehicles from 
the road for one year. 
This program supports SDG 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and 
sustainable. The bike share program contributes to target 11.2, which has several aims, including providing access 
to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all.
