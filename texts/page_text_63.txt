In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 50 million families earn a 
living from small farms, which produce 80% of the continent’s 
food. But harvests still lag far behind the rest of the world. 
The nonprofit One Acre Fund supplies smallholder farmers 
with everything they need to grow more food and earn more 
money, with the primary goal of enhancing food security. In 
partnership with the U.S. International Development Finance 
Corporation (DFC), Citi structured a $10 million flexible working 
capital solution for One Acre Fund in Kenya and an additional 
$5 million working capital facility for the other seven African 
countries where One Acre Fund operates. Since 2015, farmers 
who participate in One Acre Fund’s programs earn on average 
nearly 50% more than peer farmers who are not on One Acre 
Fund-supported activities.
EXPANDING ACCESS TO LOANS IN BANGLADESH 
Basic Unit for Resources and Opportunities of Bangladesh  
(BURO Bangladesh) is a leading microfinance institution that 
offers high-quality loans, savings and insurance to small 
businesses, smallholder farmers and women. BURO Bangladesh 
currently serves more than 2.2 million low-income women,  
with average loans of approximately $850. In 2021, Citi was  
the sole arranger of $68 million in in equivalent local currency, 
which is expected to give 85,000 people — 80% of them  
women — access to finance.
