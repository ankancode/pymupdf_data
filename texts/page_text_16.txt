Stakeholder	Engagement	at	Citi	
As a signatory to the Business 
Roundtable’s Statement on the 
Purpose of a Corporation, Citi 
is committed to ongoing and 
extensive engagement with our 
stakeholders. 
We	subscribe	to	a	broad	stakeholder	capi-
talism	approach,	believing	that	we	are	best	
able	to	create	business	value	when	we	serve	
the	interests	of	a	wide	array	of	stakeholders,	
including	our	shareholders.	We	made	a	
deliberate	effort	to	continue	stakeholder	
engagement	in	a	pandemic	environment.
To	fulfill	this	approach,	we	regularly	review	
our	stakeholder	partnerships	across	a	
range	of	functions,	including	Public	Affairs,	
Investor	Relations,	Human	Resources	
and	Corporate	Governance,	as	well	as	
Sustainability,	Government	Affairs	and	other	
teams	in	Public	Affairs.	
The	table	below	includes	examples	of	our	
recent	stakeholder	engagement	efforts.
