TRANSPARENCY FOR EMPLOYEES
Annual Ethics Hotline Summary
Each year, the Citi Ethics Office provides all employees with a summary of the types of concerns received through 
the Ethics Hotline and the types of corrective actions that may arise from substantiated concerns. This summary 
demonstrates that the Ethics Hotline process is used by our colleagues globally and that raising concerns to the Citi 
Ethics Office leads to meaningful action within our organization, such as disciplinary action, termination of vendor 
relationships, referrals to law enforcement or governmental authorities, employee communications, additional training, 
control enhancements, and changes to Citi policies, business processes and procedures.
Spotlight on Ethics
Citi shares with employees the results of ethics investigations, including a summary of corrective actions, through 
a quarterly communication called the Spotlight on Ethics. This communication reinforces for employees that their 
concerns are investigated and highlights commonplace areas in which ethical lapses can occur. In 2021, the Spotlight 
on Ethics focused on select risk areas such as protecting information from inappropriate uses, the prohibition on using 
unapproved communication methods to conduct Citi business, preventing retaliation or the suppression of concerns, and 
the requirement to cooperate with appropriately authorized internal or external investigations.
