Diversity,	Equity	&	Inclusion
Our workforce of more than 
220,000 colleagues around 
the globe reflects the diverse 
backgrounds and perspectives 
of our clients and customers. 
This is why we ensure equity 
and inclusion are embedded in 
everything that we do. 
Across	the	firm,	there	is	tremendous	
momentum	to	build	on	our	efforts	to	
create	a	more	diverse,	equitable	and	inclu-
sive	culture	—	from	our	pay	equity	work	
to	our	representation	goals	to	our	diverse	
interview	panels	and	candidate	slates	to	
our	engagement	with	Historically	Black	
Colleges	and	Universities	(HBCUs).	We	
believe	in	setting	clear	goals	to	measure	
our	progress	and	holding	ourselves	
accountable	to	building	a	company	
where	the	best	talent	wants	to	work	and	
where	people	of	all	races,	gender,	sexual	
orientation,	disability	status	veteran	status	
or	ethnicity	can	reach	their	full	potential.
Our	approach	to	diversity,	equity	and	
inclusion	(DEI)	isn’t	limited	to	broadening	
the	representation	of	those	working	within	
the	top	levels	of	our	own	firm	and	creating	
a	more	inclusive	environment.	We	also	look	
at	diversity	holistically,	thinking	of	ways	to	
widen	our	impact	for	our	suppliers,	clients,	
customers	and	communities	we	serve.	Learn

help	close	the	racial	wealth	gap	and	increase	
economic	mobility	in	the	United	States.
Pay Equity
We	continue	to	disclose	our	adjusted	
and	unadjusted	(or	“raw”)	pay	gaps	for	
both	women	and	U.S.	minorities	to	hold	
ourselves	accountable	for	making	progress.	
The	adjusted	pay	gap	is	a	true	measure	of	
pay	equity,	or	“like	for	like,”	that	compares	
the	compensation	of	women	to	men	and	
U.S.	minorities	to	non-minorities	when	
adjusting	for	factors	such	as	job	func-
tion,	title/level	and	geography.	The	raw	
gap	measures	the	difference	in	median	
compensation	when	we	don’t	adjust	for	any	
of	the	aforementioned	factors.
The	existence	of	our	raw	pay	gap	reflects	a	
need	to	increase	representation	of	women	
and	U.S.	minorities	in	senior	and	higher-
paying	roles.	
Our	latest	results,	released	in	early	2022,	
found	that,	on	an	adjusted	basis,	women	
globally	are	paid	on	average	more	than	
99%	of	what	men	are	paid	at	Citi,	and	
that	there	was	no	statistically	significant	
difference	in	adjusted	compensation	
for	U.S.	minorities	and	non-minorities.	
Following	the	review,	appropriate	pay	
adjustments	were	made	as	part	of	Citi’s	
2021	compensation	cycle.
The Interconnected Nature of Pay Gaps and Representation Goals
Citi was the first company to disclose adjusted pay results, and in 2019 we became one of the first companies to disclose our unadjusted or “raw” pay 
gaps for both women and U.S. minorities. Being transparent about our median pay helped us achieve our firm-wide, aspirational representation goals in 
2021. By increasing representation of women and U.S. minorities in higher-compensated roles, we can continue to work toward closing the raw pay gaps.
