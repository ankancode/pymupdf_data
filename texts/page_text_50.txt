Operational  
Footprint Goals
We	have	been	measuring	our	environ-
mental	footprint	for	two	decades	and	
began	reporting	on	our	direct	operational	
impacts	in	2002.	This	report	marks	our	
first	disclosure	on	progress	against	our	
fourth	generation	of	operational	footprint	
goals,	which	we	announced	in	2020	and	
aim	to	achieve	by	2025.	These	goals	are	
aligned	with	a	pathway	to	limit	global	
temperature	rise	to	1.5°C	and	cover	GHG	
emissions,	energy	use,	water	consumption,	
waste	reduction	and	diversion,	and	sustain-
able	building	design.	
Because	of	the	ongoing	COVID-19	
pandemic,	our	facilities	were	not	used	
at	full	capacity	in	2021,	and	our	related	
resource	consumption,	waste	generation	
and	GHG	emissions	were	lower	than	they	
otherwise	would	have	been.	We	recognize	
that	in	some	cases	these	impacts	were	
simply	moved	to	employees’	homes	and	
other	non-Citi	facilities.	As	a	result	of	
having	fewer	people	using	Citi	buildings,	
our	progress	for	2021	indicates	that	we	
exceeded	some	of	our	goals	during	the	
year.	That	trend	could	briefly	reverse	in	the	
coming	years	as	our	employees	continue	
to	return	to	the	office,	before	progressing	
again	toward	meeting	our	goals.	
2025 Operational Footprint Goals
This is the first year we are reporting progress against our 2025 goals. We expect our progress to fluctuate as the number of people occupying 
our facilities varies during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
In connection with our renewable electricity commitment, Citi is a member of RE100 — a global initiative led by the Climate Group and CDP 
(formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which are both part of the We Mean Business Coalition. In recognition of RE100’s requirements, we 
strive as much as possible to source 100% renewable electricity within the same market boundaries as our consumption.
