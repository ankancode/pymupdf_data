The	PCAF	methodology	is	primarily	focused	on	reporting	financed	emissions	on	an	annual	basis	and	relies	on	data	of	funds	outstand-
ing,	not	the	total	funds	that	a	financial	institution	may	have	committed	to	the	client	in	the	reporting	year.	While	we	intend	to	continue	
disclosing	per	the	PCAF	requirements	to	provide	this	annual	view	of	financed	emissions	associated	with	our	activities,	we	are	using	
“committed	funds”	data	to	more	holistically	attribute	our	clients’	emissions	for	the	baseline	financed	emissions	figures	in	our	net	zero	
plan.	Consequently,	we	undertook	an	additional	analysis	of	our	Energy	and	Power	loan	portfolios	using	total	committed	funds	to	calcu-
late	baseline	emissions	from	2020	and	establish	2030	emission	targets.	The	use	of	committed	funds	in	this	context	provides	a	more	
accurate	reflection	of	the	maximum	emissions-generating	activity	that	Citi	has	agreed	to	finance	and	is	therefore	better	suited	for	the	
purposes	of	forward-looking	emissions	management	and	target	setting.	This	approach	results	in	discrepancies	between	the	metrics	we	
report	for	PCAF	and	for	our	net	zero	targets,	but	we	believe	the	committed	funds	approach	is	better	aligned	with	the	way	we	expect	to	
manage	our	net	zero	targets.

2020 ABSOLUTE FINANCED EMISSIONS: OUTSTANDING EXPOSURE (MT CO2E*)
2020 ABSOLUTE FINANCED EMISSIONS: COMMITTED EXPOSURE (MT CO2E)
To	reach	net	zero,	we	must	move	from	our	baseline	across	a	decarbonization	pathway	to	our	ultimate	net	zero	target.	Establishing	2030	
targets	are	the	first	step	in	that	journey.	The	next	step	is	to	develop	an	implementation	plan	to	achieve	targeted	reductions	in	each	
relevant	sector.	We	are	evaluating	a	number	of	strategies	and	tools	to	drive	towards	the	established	goals,	though	they	may	not	all	be	
applicable	for	every	sector	or	client.	Some	of	the	emissions	reduction	approaches	and	potential	future	tools	include	client	engagement,	
capital	allocation	strategy	and	portfolio	management	tools.	
The	table	on	the	following	page	summarizes	our	current	2030	emission	targets	for	Citi’s	Energy	and	Power	portfolios.	These	interim	
2030	targets	are	a	key	component	of	our	net	zero	plan	for	emissions	in	our	client	portfolio.	
Energy and Power Baseline Emissions and Interim Targets
During	2021,	we	used	the	PCAF	methodology	to	conduct	an	analysis	of	our	Energy	and	Power	portfolios	using	2020	data.	In	alignment	
with	PCAF	requirements,	this	analysis	is	based	on	funds	outstanding	(drawn	and	not	yet	repaid)	by	clients	during	the	year	to	provide	a	
view	of	financed	emissions	associated	with	our	activities	during	that	year.
