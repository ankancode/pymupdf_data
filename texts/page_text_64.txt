SUPPORTING LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE  
IN MEXICO  
Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Públicos, Sociedad 
Nacional de Crédito (Banobras) is a state-owned Mexican 
development bank that seeks to improve the quality of life 
of local populations while contributing to the country’s 
sustainable development. Banobras provides financing to 
public and private investment projects focused on the delivery 
of essential infrastructure and public service projects. In 
September, Citibanamex acted as a joint bookrunner for an 
approximately $500,000 local sustainability bond linked 
to basic infrastructure projects — infrastructure damaged 
by natural disasters; renewables: wind farms, photovoltaic 
plants and/or hydroelectric plants; sustainable transportation; 
wastewater treatment plants; and hospitals and energy 
efficiency projects.
