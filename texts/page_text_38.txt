Considerations for Loan Portfolio Assessments
Energy and Power Sectors 
GHG Emissions Public Disclosure
Review public disclosures such as sustainability reports 
or submissions to the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 
and supplement with direct engagement with clients
GHG Emissions Reduction Targets
Review public statements on net zero/decarbonization 
commitments or alignment with external initiatives such 
as the Science Based Targets initiative. For the Energy 
sector, assess targets for GHGs such as methane
Decarbonization/Transition Plan
Understand clients’ climate transition plans. Determine  
the tools that clients will employ, including capital  
allocation, product diversification and linkages to  
executive compensation
Climate Risk Scoring
Harness public discourse and statements and third-party 
data as well as our ongoing client engagement, to develop 
an internal assessment for both transition and physical risk
Client Asset Evaluation
Where available, review asset-level data for further  
assessments of climate risk and emissions intensity;  
this is particularly applicable to project finance
External Climate Scores
Reference third-party ratings systems for additional 
data on climate-related performance
Other Data
Consider the social elements of transition, including  
human rights risks, access to energy for developing  
countries, livelihoods of communities and workers in  
these sectors and the relevant regulatory environment

The first step of our net zero plan involves engagement, client by client, to understand 
each client’s GHG emissions disclosure and their perspective and plans for transition. 
Additionally, we will review public disclosures, climate governance and the commit-
ments and actions they have taken to date. We anticipate that this initial review phase 
will continue through the end of 2023. In the following table, we highlight some of the 
key considerations that will frame client engagement.
