responsibility	with	our	colleagues	across	
the	company.	
Our	goal	is	for	all	suppliers	to	complete	the	
CRQ	every	two	years.	This	helps	improve	
environmental	and	social	practices	
throughout	our	supply	chain.	
Supply Chain 
Sustainability  
Focus Areas
Citi	has	three	sustainability	focus	areas	
for	our	supply	chain:	paper	and	paper	
products,	IT	hardware	and	e-waste	
disposal,	and	travel	and	logistics.	We	have	
developed	actions	for	each	of	these	areas	
and	incorporated	them	into	our	supply	
chain	Global	Operating	Procedures.	
As	a	result	of	choosing	EPEAT-certified	
options	for	99%	of	our	deployed	servers,	
laptops,	desktop	computers,	monitors	and	
mobile	phones,	we	estimate	an	energy	
savings	of	273	million	kilowatt-hours	and	
a	greenhouse	gas	reduction	of	57,200	
metric	tons	of	CO2	over	the	life	cycle	of	the	
products.	
In	support	of	responsible	forestry,	Citi	
made	a	commitment	in	2020	to	use	
Forest	Stewardship	Council	(FSC)	Chain	
of	Custody-certified	paper	for	the	outer	
envelopes	used	for	statements	and	
customer	communications.	During	2021,	
we	made	the	transition	to	and	began	using	
FSC-certified	paper	for	outer	envelopes.	
We	also	began	integrating	a	requirement	
for	FSC-certified	bulk	roll	paper	(used	for	
printing	statements)	into	our	Request	for	
Proposal	(RFP)	process.	However,	we	have	
paused	this	effort	due	to	global	supply	
chain	disruptions	that	have	posed	serious	
challenges	to	sourcing	adequate	amounts	
of	FSC-certified	paper.	We	will	reassess	
whether	it	is	possible	to	move	forward	with	
updated	RFPs	in	2022	and	continue	to	
advance	our	use	of	digital	alternatives.
