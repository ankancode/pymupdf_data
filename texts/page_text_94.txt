Employee Network Listening Tour   
In 2021, we held our first ever “Voice of the People” listening tour to help us understand what our Affinities mean 
to our colleagues. More than 800 Citi employees attended in-person and virtual sessions to share their views on 
our Affinity Networks and to offer ideas about what we can do to make them more impactful. More than 80% of 
participants said they joined one of the Affinities for networking opportunities.
