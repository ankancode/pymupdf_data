Voice of the Employee
 
Our annual Voice of the Employee (VOE) survey provides valuable insights regarding employee engagement and perceptions about 
our firm — our successes as well as our pain points. In 2021, participation was high — 87% of colleagues globally responded. 
We heard employees are embracing the Leadership Principles we rolled out in March, with all three principles approaching 90% 
favorability. Overall, 91% of employees said they are proud to work for Citi and felt that our commitments to an ethical culture and 
diversity are strong.
Nearly 90% of employees said their managers promote diversity, equity and inclusion on their teams. But many colleagues are looking 
for their managers to provide greater support in their career development — a perennial area for improvement across the firm.
While colleagues gave us high marks for our response to COVID-19, employees shared they are feeling the strain of life during the 
pandemic and increased workloads. These feelings were especially acute among our women colleagues. Their responses have reaffirmed 
the importance of our efforts, and we will continue to address this feedback to help relieve stress, simplify our working processes, 
develop tools for collaboration and ensure that our managers continue to support their people.
