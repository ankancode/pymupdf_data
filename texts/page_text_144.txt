strategic development opportunities and behaviors needed to enhance current performance and 
prepare for future roles. These plans are discussed as part of mid-year and year-end reviews, and 
employees are encouraged to take part in stretch assignments and development programs to further 
build skills. All Citi employees have the ability to request feedback from and provide feedback to 
colleagues, while managers can also ask for feedback on team members throughout the year.
