The	climate	crisis	has	created	not	just	an	
opportunity	to	lead	—	but	an	opportunity	
to	partner:	working	with	our	clients	to	
decarbonize	their	businesses	as	part	of	
our	journey	to	net	zero.
The	science	is	clear,	as	is	the	need	to	move	
urgently	toward	a	low-carbon	economy.	
The	financial	sector	has	a	critical	role	
to	play	in	supporting	other	industries	
to	reduce	their	environmental	impacts	
and	transition	their	business	models	in	
line	with	what	is	needed	to	keep	global	
warming	to	1.5°C.
Our	Sustainable	Progress	Strategy	builds	
on	our	decades-long	track	record	in	
sustainability	and	environmental	finance.	
To	drive	the	transition	to	a	low-carbon	
economy,	we	are	drawing	on	our	expertise,	
expanding	our	business	unit	capabilities	
and	deepening	our	engagement	with	
the	carbon-intensive	sectors	that	are	of	
highest	priority	for	transformation.		
The	strategy,	which	is	integrated	into	
our	Environmental	and	Social	Policy	
Framework,	focuses	on	three	areas:	
financing	the	low-carbon	transition,	
deepening	climate	risk	assessment	
and	disclosure,	and	reducing	the	
environmental	impacts	of	our	own	
operations.	The	environmental	finance	
transactions	that	count	toward	our	
$1	trillion	commitment	to	sustainable	
finance,	which	also	includes	a	commitment	
to	social	finance,	illustrate	how	Citi	is	
contributing	to	the	low-carbon	transition.	
One	year	after	setting	our	Sustainable	
Progress	Strategy,	we	took	an	important	
next	step	on	the	path	toward	a	low-carbon	
future,	pledging	to	achieve	net	zero	
greenhouse	gas	(GHG)	emissions	for	our	
financing	(by	2050)	and	for	our	operations	
(by	2030).
