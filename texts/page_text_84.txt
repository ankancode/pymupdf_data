A Roadmap for Black Equity
In November 2021, we announced our participation in the Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) Black Equity at Work 
Certification — a first-of-its-kind standard and roadmap for employers that want to achieve Black equity internally while support-
ing Black equity in society. Citi was the first major Wall Street bank to sign on. Our participation complements our Action for 
Racial Equity efforts, including our commitment to conduct a third-party racial equity audit. (Learn more in the Equitable and 
Resilient Communities section.) 
MLT’s unique accreditation program calls on corporations to take a stand for Black equity and provides a critical resource 
for employers to make progress toward their Black equity goals. Through our participation in this program, Citi will receive 
MLT’s expertise, counsel and feedback on our internal Black equity initiatives and practices, including how we can increase 
Black representation, drive equal pay and invest in Black equity causes. The validation process will help Citi develop a robust, 
comprehensive plan that will enable us to achieve a Black Equity at Work Certification in one to three years.
DIVERSITY AT THE 
EXECUTIVE LEVEL
Gender equity is something we 
demonstrate from the very top 
of our organization. Jane Fraser 
is our first woman CEO — and 
was the first woman to lead a 
major Wall Street bank. Based 
on existing self-identification 
data, five (29%) of our 17-person 
Executive Management Team 
are women and six (35%) are 
racially/ethnically diverse. As 
of April 25, 2022, eight (53%) 
of the 15 members of our Board 
of Directors are women and 
three (20%) are racial/ethnic 
minorities. Citi was among the 
first financial services firms  
to achieve gender parity on  
its Board.
