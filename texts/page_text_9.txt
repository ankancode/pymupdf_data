ESG	Governance	at	Citi
Good governance is a fundamental 
principle at Citi, and we work to 
ensure that we are at the leading 
edge of best practices. We strive 
to maintain the highest standards 
of ethical conduct — reporting 
with accuracy and transparency 
and complying with the laws, rules 
and regulations that govern Citi’s 
businesses. 
Corporate Governance
Our	governance	structures,	policies	and	
processes	serve	employee,	client	and	
community	needs;	promote	a	culture	of	
accountability	and	ethical	conduct	across	
our	firm;	and	support	our	commitment	
to	address	global	challenges	through	our	
core	business.	
Citi’s	Board	of	Directors	plays	an	
important	role	in	providing	oversight	of	
our	efforts	to	ensure	responsible	business	
practices.	For	example,	the	Personnel	
and	Compensation	Committee	reviews	
all	compensation	programs,	including	
incentive	compensation,	so	that	they	
do	not,	among	other	things,	encourage	
imprudent	risk	taking.	The	Nomination,	
Governance	and	Public	Affairs	Committee	
(NGPAC)	oversees	Citi’s	global	ESG	
activities	and	performance.	Our	Ethics,	
Conduct	and	Culture	Committee	reflects	
our	commitment	to	promote	a	strong	
culture	of	ethical	conduct.	The	Risk	
Management	Committee	also	provides	
oversight	of	climate	risk.
Standing	committees	of	our	Board	include:	
	•
Audit	
	•
Ethics,	Conduct	and	Culture	
	•
Executive	
	•
Nomination,	Governance	and		
Public	Affairs	
	•
Personnel	and	Compensation
	•
Risk	Management	
In	addition,	the	Board	formed	the	
Transformation	Oversight	Committee,	an	
ad	hoc	committee	to	provide	oversight	of	
management’s	remediation	of	the	issues	
identified	in	the	consent	orders	with	the	
Federal	Reserve	Board	and	Office	of	the	
Comptroller	of	the	Currency.

about	Citi’s	corporate	governance,	includ-
ing	our	Board	committee	charters.	See	our	
2021	TCFD	Report	for	details	on	our	gover-
nance	for	climate	change	specifically.	
ESG Governance 
The	NGPAC	oversees	our	ESG	activities.	
This	committee’s	responsibilities	include	
reviewing	our	policies	and	programs	for	
sustainability,	climate	change,	human	
rights,	diversity	and	other	material	ESG	
issues,	as	well	as	advising	on	engage-
ment	with	external	stakeholders.	For	
more	information	on	the	roles	and	
responsibilities	of	this	committee,	see	
the	Nomination,	Governance	and	Public	
Affairs	Committee	charter.	
In	July	2021,	we	formed	a	new	Global	ESG	
Council	to	provide	a	senior	management	
forum	for	oversight	of	our	ESG	commit-
ments	and	ambition.	The	formation	of	
the	Council	highlights	our	commitment	to	
ESG	matters,	including	our	climate-related	
strategies,	at	the	highest	level	of	our	
organization.	Chaired	by	our	CEO,	the	
Council	meets	on	a	near-monthly	basis	
and	includes	members	of	the	Executive	
Management	Team	as	well	as	internal
