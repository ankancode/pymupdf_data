Citi’s	mission	is	to	serve	as	a	trusted	part-
ner	to	our	clients	by	responsibly	providing	
financial	services	that	enable	growth	and	
economic	progress.	Our	core	activities	are	
safeguarding	assets,	lending	money,	mak-
ing	payments	and	accessing	the	capital	
markets	on	behalf	of	our	clients.	We	have	
over	200	years	of	experience	helping	our	
clients	meet	the	world’s	toughest	challeng-
es	and	embrace	its	greatest	opportunities.	
As	an	institution,	Citi	is	connecting	millions	
of	people	across	hundreds	of	countries	
and	cities.	
We	protect	people’s	savings	and	help	
them	make	the	purchases	—	from	everyday	
transactions	to	buying	a	home	—	that	
improve	the	quality	of	their	lives.	We	
advise	people	on	how	to	invest	for	future	
needs,	such	as	their	children’s	education	
and	their	own	retirement,	and	help	them	
buy	securities	such	as	stocks	and	bonds.	
We	work	with	companies	to	optimize	their	
daily	operations,	whether	they	need	
working	capital,	to	make	payroll	or	to	
export	their	goods	overseas.	By	lending	to	
companies	large	and	small,	we	help	them	
grow,	creating	jobs	and	real	economic	
value	at	home	and	in	communities	around	
the	world.	We	provide	financing	and	
support	to	governments	at	all	levels,	so	
they	can	build	sustainable	infrastructure,	
such	as	housing,	transportation,	schools	
and	other	vital	public	works.	
We	have	an	obligation	to	act	responsibly.	
We	also	know	that	acting	responsibly	
and	sustainably	will	help	to	drive	value	
for	our	different	stakeholders	and	for	
our	company.	If	we	fall	short,	we	will	take	
action	and	learn	from	our	experience.	
We	strive	to	earn	and	maintain	the	
public’s	trust	by	constantly	adhering	to	
the	highest	ethical	standards.	We	ask	our	
colleagues	to	ensure	that	their	decisions	
pass	three	tests:	They	are	in	our	clients’	
interests,	create	economic	value,	and	
are	always	systemically	responsible.	
When	we	do	these	things	well,	we	make	a	
positive	financial	and	social	impact	in	the	
communities	we	serve	and	show	what	a	
global	bank	can	do.
