About	This	
	
Report
This report illustrates how we bring our mission to life through our business; it covers 
our environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities, performance and approach 
for calendar year 2021, focusing on the issues we have determined to be of material1 
importance from an ESG perspective, which is a broader standard than that used in our 
financial disclosures. 
This	report	has	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	GRI	Standards:	Core	option.	We	also	used	three	relevant	
sector	standards	from	the	Sustainability	Accounting	Standards	Board,	the	Principles	for	Responsible	Banking,	
the	United	Nations	(UN)	Global	Compact	and	the	UN	Guiding	Principles	on	Business	and	Human	Rights	
frameworks	to	guide	our	reporting.	(See	related	indexes.)	
We	have	embedded	the	UN	Sustainable	Development	Goals	into	relevant	sections	of	the	report	where	Citi	plays	
a	direct	role	in	making	progress	toward	specific	goals.	Additionally,	we	include	an	index	that	indicates	where	
report	content	is	specifically	aligned	to	the	recommendations	of	the	Financial	Stability	Board’s	Task	Force	
on	Climate-related	Financial	Disclosures.	Finally,	this	report	supplements	information	published	in	our	2021	
Annual	Report.	
All	reporting	and	performance	data	are	limited	to	information	for	the	owned	and	operated	facilities	of	Citigroup	
Inc.	and	its	subsidiaries,	unless	stated	otherwise.	Additional	information	about	Citi	can	be	found	on	our	website.
