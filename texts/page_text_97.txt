Fair Employment Practices
We strive to maintain an environment in which development opportunities are 
widely available, where people are hired and advanced on their merits and where 
our employees treat each other with respect. We are fully committed to equal 
employment opportunities, fair employment practices and nondiscrimination. 
For more information, see the Human Rights section of this report, our Code of 
Conduct and our website for policies around fair employment and compensation. 
More information can also be found in the GRI Index of this report.
