Transition 
Risks
Regulatory 
No regulatory/policy 
changes are expected 
to meaningfully 
impact the sector 
financially such 
as through asset 
devaluation, increased 
expenditure (e.g., 
compliance costs) 
and/or loss of revenue
Minor impact to the sector 
expected from potential 
regulatory/policy changes 
(e.g., building efficiency) 
resulting in financial 
impact asset devaluation, 
increased expenditure 
(e.g., compliance costs) 
or loss of revenue; 
impact only on a subset 
of the sector, subset of 
geographies and/or only 
indirect impact
Moderate impact to the 
sector expected from 
regulatory/policy changes 
(e.g., carbon taxes) 
relating to the sector’s 
carbon intensity; direct 
impact with noticeable 
economic implications 
on the sector through 
impacted asset valuation, 
increased expenditure 
(e.g., compliance costs) 
and/or revenue loss
Major impact to the 
sector expected due to 
expected regulatory/ 
policy changes relating 
to the sector’s carbon 
intensity; significant shift 
expected in the business 
model or economics of 
the sector impacting 
asset valuation, 
expenditures (e.g., 
increased compliance 
costs) and/or revenue
Technology
Outside of general 
modernization of tech-
nology, no technology 
shifts are expected for 
the sector
Minor impact to the sector 
expected from technology 
changes (i.e., impact only 
on a small subset of the 
sector, or only indirect 
impact through supply 
chain) that result in 
market share loss
Moderate impact to the 
sector expected from 
technology changes, 
resulting in some shift in 
the economics of some 
companies in the sector 
leading to market share 
loss
Major impact to the 
sector expected from 
technology changes, 
resulting in substitution 
of a significant portion of 
existing companies (i.e., 
market share loss)
Stakeholder
There is no 
expectation of 
stakeholder 
composition or 
preferences changing 
for the industry
Minor stakeholder impact 
due to expected shift in 
preferences, with minor 
financial impact on 
companies (e.g., revenue, 
vendor pricing)
Moderate stakeholder 
impact is expected for 
the sector in terms of 
stakeholder preferences 
and composition, with 
modest financial impact 
(e.g., revenue, vendor 
pricing)
Major stakeholder impact 
is expected in terms of 
both client preferenc-
es and composition of 
stakeholders, resulting 
in significant financial 
impact (e.g., revenue loss, 
vendor pricing)
Legal
No increased litigation 
concerns are expected 
to impact the industry 
that would lead to 
increased financial 
burden (e.g., legal 
fees, settlements)
Minor litigation concerns 
are expected to impact the 
sector, with minor financial 
consequences (e.g., legal 
fees, settlements)
Moderate litigation 
concerns are expected 
to impact the sector, 
with modest financial 
impact (e.g., legal fees, 
settlements)
Major litigation is 
expected to impact the 
sector, with significant 
financial impact (e.g., 
legal fees, settlements)
Physical 
Risks
Acute 
Hazard
Acute physical 
hazards have no 
impact on the day-
to-day operations 
of companies in the 
sector
Sector would experience 
minor impact from acute 
physical hazards on 
operations (e.g., revenue 
loss due to business 
disruption), or minor 
damage to assets (e.g., 
asset devaluation)
Sector would experience 
moderate and protracted 
impact from acute 
physical hazards on 
operations (e.g., revenue 
loss due to business 
disruption), or moderate 
damage to assets (e.g., 
asset devaluation)
Sector would experience 
major and protracted im-
pact from acute physical 
hazards on operations 
(e.g., revenue loss due to 
business disruption),
or significant damage 
to assets (e.g., asset 
devaluation)
Chronic 
Hazard
Chronic physical 
hazards have no 
impact on the 
operations or 
valuation of assets/
companies in the 
sector
Chronic physical hazards 
have minor potential 
impact on the operations 
(e.g., increased insurance 
cost) or valuation of 
assets/companies in the 
sector
Sector would experience 
moderate and sustained 
impact on the operations 
(e.g., increased insur-
ance cost) or valuation 
of assets/companies in 
the sector
Sector would experience 
major and irreversible 
impact on the operations 
or valuation of assets/ 
companies in the sector
