Over the past two years, the 
COVID-19 pandemic reaffirmed 
the urgency to address the 
vast and growing inequities 
facing our global society, from 
financial security and access 
to basic human necessities to 
affordable housing and economic 
opportunity. Throughout 2021, 
Citi and the Citi Foundation 
accelerated and expanded 
investments in communities 
around the world, helping to 
support a more inclusive recovery 
and more equitable future. 
Building	on	our	longstanding	leadership	in	
financial	inclusion,	we	expanded	the	scope	
of	our	social	finance	efforts	to	maximize	
our	impacts	and	to	help	achieve	the	$500	
Billion	Social	Finance	Goal	we	set	as	part	
of	our	overall	$1	trillion	commitment	to	
sustainable	finance	by	2030.	We	invested	
$1	billion	in	a	broad	suite	of	initiatives	
designed	to	help	close	the	racial	wealth	
gap	in	the	United	States	and	to	increase	
economic	mobility	through	Citi	and	the	
Citi	Foundation’s	Action for Racial Equity	
commitment.	And	we	increased	our	invest-
ments	in	the	Citi	Impact	Fund,	more	than	
half	of	which	went	to	minority-owned	and	
women-owned	companies.
We	also	continued	to	support	COVID-19	
relief	and	recovery	efforts	globally	while	
staying	focused	on	our	long-term	priorities,	
including	affordable	housing	and	the	Citi	
Foundation’s	strategic	grantmaking	efforts.
