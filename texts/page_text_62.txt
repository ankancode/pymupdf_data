Bond Offerings Advance Social Initiatives
In October 2021, we issued our inaugural Citi Social Finance Bond, a $1 billion bond offering to support social and economic development 
efforts or activities that increase opportunity and access to essential basic services. Proceeds from the bond will finance a range of 
projects, including those that expand access to financial services, affordable housing, basic infrastructure, healthcare and education in 
underserved and unbanked communities in emerging markets.
The bond offering followed the release of our Citi Social Finance Framework, one of the world’s first global social finance frameworks 
focused on enabling financial inclusion, affordable housing and access to essential services in emerging markets. The framework, which 
was developed in line with the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Social Bond Principles 2021,*  details how projects and 
assets will be selected. We will report annually on the use of funds and related impacts.
The Citi Social Finance Bond follows the 2020 issuance of Citi’s inaugural $2.5 billion Affordable Housing Bond, which was then the 
largest-ever social bond from an issuer in the private sector. Learn more.
