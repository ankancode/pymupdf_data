Our	Early Identification Program	
focuses	on	mentorship,	interview		
preparation	and	best-in-class	training		
to	identify	diverse	talent	for	our		
summer	analyst	programs	over	a		
five-week	period. 
	•
Sophomore Leadership Program	
provides	hands-on	work	experience,	
mentorship,	peer	networking	and	
necessary	skills	over	a	10-week	summer	
internship,	to	provide	a	pipeline	into	our	
full-time	analyst	programs.
We	continue	to	partner	with	Jopwell,	MLT,	
SEO	and	WayUp,	U.S.-based	recruiting	
platforms	that	attract	diverse	students,	
enabling	our	recruiters	to	communicate	
and	engage	with	students	to	promote	job	
opportunities.	We	were	also	honored	to	
receive	the	Diversity,	Equity	and	Inclusion	
Award	and	received	an	Honorable	Mention	
for	Recruiting	Excellence	from	the	National	
Association	of	Colleges	and	Employers.
Developing Diverse Talent  
Hiring,	promoting	and	retaining	more	
women	and	racial/ethnic	minorities	in	
senior,	high-paying	roles	is	critical	to	our	
success	—	and	key	to	helping	solve	the	
two-pronged	issue	of	representation	and	
pay	equity.	Career	development	is	one	of	
our	top	priorities,	and	we	promote	from	
within	to	continue	developing	our	existing	
talent.	In	2021,	41% of open positions at 
Citi were filled with internal candidates.		
“Owning	My	Success”	(OMS),	for	example,	
is	a	group	coaching	program	for	Black	
colleagues	that	provides	exposure	to	
Citi’s	senior	leadership	and	supports	
professional	and	personal	development.	
More	than	700	Black	colleagues	have	
participated	in	OMS	since	the	program	
began	in	2018.	Over	the	course	of	several	
months,	participants	join	group	coaching	
circles,	led	by	an	external	executive	coach	
and	a	senior	leader	at	Citi.	Managers	of	the	
participants	also	take	part	in	group	coach-
ing	to	better	understand	the	experience	of	
Black	colleagues	in	the	workplace.

CITI ON THE VINEYARD RECRUITMENT
Following a successful recruitment event in 2019, Citi held a second 
recruitment event on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts for Black students 
to network with industry professionals and learn about potential career 
paths in financial services. In total, 20+ college students and 12 high school 
students attended the August 2021 event. Two of the college students were 
selected for our Early ID Leadership Program, and we’re inviting the high 
school students to return to future programming. 
CITI INTRODUCTION  
TO FINANCE
More than 1,000 people attended 
a virtual event in August geared 
toward mid- to senior-level Black 
talent. Our CFO Mark Mason 
and Chief Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion Officer Erika Irish Brown 
discussed their respective careers 
in finance. Several participants 
in the event interviewed for 
positions across the team.
