training	to	capability	building.	As	a	result,	
TCGi	is	building	holistic	expertise	including	
technical,	functional	and	soft	skills.	
We	continue	to	host	events	for	diverse	
businesses	across	the	globe	to	share	best	
practices	for	doing	business	with	Citi	and	
other	large	companies.	Our	global	“Doing	
Business	with	Citi”	session	is	open	to	any	
supplier	affiliated	with	select	diversity	
certification	agencies.	The	2021	event	had	
nearly	700	attendees,	most	of	whom	were	
diverse	suppliers.
In	addition,	Citi	participated	in	the	NMSDC	
Emerging	Entrepreneurs	Program,	which	
includes	a	new	mentoring	approach	called	
Success	Circles.	Entrepreneurs	are	placed	
with	a	group	of	experts	who	use	their	
collective	talents	and	connections	to	help	
the	entrepreneurs	build	their	businesses.	
Citi	also	provided	a	scholarship	to	the	
Tuck	School	of	Business	Minority	Business	
Enterprise	Program	as	part	of	this	
initiative.	
During	2021,	we	collaborated	with	the	
New	York	&	New	Jersey	Minority	Supplier	
Development	Council	to	host	the	11th	
annual	Sustainability	Symposium,	where	
Citi	hosted	and	moderated	a	Sustainability	
panel.	Panelists	shared	perspectives	on	
supply	chain	sustainability,	ESG	metrics,	
human	rights,	net	zero	carbon	emissions	
programs	and	the	impact	of	COVID-19	
on	business	growth.	The	panel	included	
leaders	from	Citi,	UN	Women,	Ernst	&	
Young	and	Accenture.
We	continue	to	support	the	Broad-Based	
Black	Economic	Empowerment	(BBBEE)	
program	in	South	Africa,	maintaining	a	
Level	3	BBBEE	Scorecard	for	the	inclusion	
of	diverse	suppliers	during	2020/2021	for	
local	operations.	
Supplier Engagement 
and Evaluation
Since	2013,	the	SCDIS	team	has	used	a	
Corporate	Responsibility	Questionnaire	
(CRQ)	to	gauge	how	effectively	our	suppli-
ers	are	managing	critical	issues,	such	as	
human	rights,	environmental	manage-
ment,	health	and	safety,	labor	practices	
and	diversity.	
In	2020,	we	began	rolling	out	an	updated	
version	of	this	evaluation	tool,	which	
includes	an	expanded	assessment	in	
the	areas	of	modern	slavery,	supplier	
diversity,	environmental	sustainability,	
corporate	responsibility,	labor	rights	and	
workplace	safety.	This	latest	version	of	
the	CRQ	brings	more	rigor	to	our	supplier	
assessment	process	and	will	continue	to	
raise	the	bar	for	our	ESG	practices	across	
Citi’s	supply	chain.	It	is	also	helping	raise	
awareness	about	supply	chain	corporate
