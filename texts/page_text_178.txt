Assurance
 
 
 
Materiality 
The materiality required of the verification was considered by SGS to be below 
10%, based on the needs of the intended user of the GHG and environmental data 
Statement 
 
Conclusion 
Citigroup, Inc. provided the GHG and environmental Statement based on the 
requirements of the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol and its amendments, the Citigroup, 
Inc. methodology and the principles of completeness, transparency, accuracy, 
consistency and relevance. The following GHG emissions and environmental data 
for the period 1st January 2021 – 31st December 2021 are verified by SGS to a 
limited level of assurance, consistent with the agreed verification scope, objectives 
and criteria.   
 
44,683 tCO2e of GHG emissions Scope 1 
463,311 tCO2e of GHG emissions Scope 2 (location based) 
60,979 tCO2e of GHG emissions Scope 2 (market based) 
507,994 tCO2e of total GHG emissions Scopes 1 and 2, based on Scope 2 location-
based emissions 
10,586 tCO2e of GHG emissions Scope 3 
 
1,110.83 GWh of electricity consumption 
26.35 GWh of district heating and cooling 
178.00 GWh of natural gas 
0.74 GWh of LPG 
0.02 GWh of fuel oil 
31.59 GWh of diesel 
5,824 metric tonnes of waste diverted from landfill 
25,595 metric tonnes of total waste 
3,366,620 cubic meters of potable water consumed 
253,010 cubic meters of non-potable water consumed 
10,554 tCO2e from business travel by air 
32 tCO2e from business travel by rail 
 
SGS’ approach is risk-based, drawing on an understanding of the risks associated 
with modeling GHG emission information and the controls in place to mitigate these 
risks. Our examination included assessment, on a sample basis, of evidence 
relevant to the voluntary reporting of emission and environmental data. 
  
SGS concludes with limited assurance that there is no evidence to suggest that the 
reported CO2 equivalent and environmental data assertion is not materially correct 
and is not a fair representation of GHG and environmental data and information 
based on the calculation methodologies utilised.
