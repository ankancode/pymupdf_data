Vaccine Alliance Advisor
 
Back in October of 2020, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, appointed Citi as the sole financial advisor to the COVAX Facility, a global multilateral 
procurement mechanism created to provide fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world. The COVAX 
Facility developed a diversified, active vaccine portfolio management strategy to secure vaccine supply for all participating countries. 
Pooled procurement gave COVAX leverage to negotiate highly competitive prices, speedy deployment and better terms, especially for 
low- and middle-income countries. 
Since that appointment, Citi has been advising on credit, liquidity and operational and contractual risks, including planning and execution 
of mitigation strategies. The Facility is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health 
Organization.  
In September 2021, Citi, in conjunction with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), began providing a risk 
management solution to Gavi to enable the funding for COVID-19 vaccine purchases through the COVAX Facility.   
In another effort to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, Citi and other leaders in the financial services sector joined CODE 
(RED) to help get vaccines and other vital defenses to hundreds of millions of people in the world’s poorest countries. Citi provided 
eligible U.S. credit card members with the option to donate their points to the CODE (RED) campaign. Citi also donated $250,000 to 
(RED)’s efforts.
