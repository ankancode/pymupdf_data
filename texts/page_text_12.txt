Our	Material	ESG	Issues:		
Citi	in	a	Global	Context	
In 2020, we conducted a 
materiality assessment to identify 
our most relevant (or “material”) 
reporting topics from an ESG 
perspective — which is a broader 
standard than that used in our 
financial disclosures. These topics 
are incorporated in the material 
issues table on the next page. 
Based	on	internal	stakeholder	interviews	
and	external	research,	the	ESG	topics	
identified,	which	we	refer	to	as	“material	
ESG	issues”	throughout	this	report,	inform	
which	issues	we	report	on,	which	issues	we	
consider	raising	to	our	Board	of	Directors,	
and	how	we	establish	our	ESG	priorities.	
When	taken	as	a	set,	the	issues	that	surfaced	
in	the	ESG	materiality	analysis	indicate	an	
increase	in	stakeholder	expectations,	in	
particular	with	regard	to	issues	connected	
to	climate	change	and	social	justice.	The	
pandemic	also	placed	increased	emphasis	
on	employee	health	and	well-being.	Most	
of	the	material	ESG	issues	outlined	on	the	
following	pages	are	not	new	to	Citi	nor	to	
our	stakeholders.	What	is	new,	however,	
is	the	magnitude	and	complexity	of	the	
changes	required	to	rise	to	these	challenges.	
For	example,	there	is	wide	recognition	that	
climate	change	is	happening	faster	and	with	
more	impact	than	previously	realized;	in	
parallel,	society	is	reacting	to	unacceptable	
levels	of	social	inequity.	
This	assessment	mirrors	—	and	informs	—	our	
increased	strategic	efforts	on	these	issues.	
It	has	also	driven	our	increased	reporting	on	
these	material	topics.
