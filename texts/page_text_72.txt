Every year, Citi colleagues, alumni, partners, clients, family 
and friends come together to participate in Global Community 
Day, our annual flagship volunteer initiative to give back in the 
communities where we live and work. For the second year in 
a row, we adapted in 2021 to find new ways of volunteering in 
lieu of in-person events.

In 2021, we put a particular focus on food insecurity and supporting organizations 
dedicated to fighting the hunger crisis, including the United Nations World Food 
Programme (WFP) and U.S. Hunger.
Global Community Day was a little different this year, 
but the impact we made was no less meaningful. From 
organizing food drives to mentoring young professionals, 
our colleagues donated their time and talent to our 
communities and demonstrated once again why Citi is  
a bank with brains and a bank with a soul.”
