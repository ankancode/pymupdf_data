While	our	transition	plans	for	each	loan	portfolio	will	be	based	on	a	rigorous	net	zero	methodology,	we	are	still	in	the	early	stages	
of	plotting	our	net	zero	journey.	We	expect	to	modify	our	transition	plans	and	targets	as	both	the	availability	and	quality	of	data	
improve	and	as	climate	scenarios	are	updated.	We	also	recognize	that	there	will	be	uneven	year-on-year	progress	toward	our	2030	
targets,	because	clients	and	sectors	differ	in	their	capacity	to	transition	and	in	the	time	frames	in	which	their	carbon	reduction	
investments	will	be	realized.
Achieving Our Targets
 
We will use a variety of approaches, many of which will run concurrently, to reach our financed emissions reduction 
targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios. For further detail on these five areas of activity, refer to our 2021 
TCFD Report.
