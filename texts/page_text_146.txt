409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk 
for incidents of forced or compulsory labor
We have not identified any operations as having significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory 
labor. In addition, we do not directly source high-risk agricultural commodities, conflict minerals 
or other raw materials in significant amounts from suppliers in high-risk jurisdictions. While our 
own business operations and supply chain are not at high risk because of the nature of work in 
the financial services industry, our ESRM policy includes processes to evaluate corporate clients 
to determine if they present a high risk of forced labor or compulsory labor and we have taken 
appropriate mitigating steps.
