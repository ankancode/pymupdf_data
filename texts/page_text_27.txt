The reporting on our progress toward our $1 trillion commitment in sustainable finance by 2030 includes measuring the en-
vironmental and social impacts associated with contributing sustainable finance projects. Where feasible, we have estimated 
the impacts representative of Citi’s financing and facilitation activities. Our impact measurement methodologies align with our 
accounting approach, reporting our share of the impacts proportional to our financial share of the transaction.
Impact Calculation Methodology Summary
Citi initiatives help to create measurable impacts for communities across the world. To estimate the environmental and social 
impacts of Citi-financed projects and activities we looked at the following metrics:
 
• Avoided GHG emissions refers to the amount of GHG emissions avoided because of Citi’s share of financing for renewable 
energy, green affordable housing and energy efficiency projects. GHG emissions avoidance is calculated by applying regional 
electric grid factors to Citi’s share of financing across three types of activities, including a low-carbon source replacing energy 
use from the grid, energy efficiency upgrades and green housing units that are LEED-certified. Impacts reflect the per annum 
benefit as opposed to benefit over entire project life.
• For renewable energy projects, total project capacity for energy is calculated as the annual capacity factor applied to  
the total project size per annum and multiplied by the CO2 emissions factor. 
• For energy efficiency upgrades, the average household energy savings is calculated as the average household energy  
use multiplied by the percentage of energy savings per thousand U.S. dollars invested. The result is multiplied by the  
total warehouse value and the CO2 emissions factor.
