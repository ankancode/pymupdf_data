We have committed $1 trillion 
to sustainable finance by 2030, 
a commitment that spans our 
business offerings and exemplifies 
how environmental and social 
finance are integrated across 
our businesses. The ambitious 
$1 trillion commitment will 
support innovation and collective 
action toward addressing 
the most significant global 
challenges that are outlined in 
the Paris Agreement and the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). 
Announced	in	April	2021,	the	$1	trillion	
commitment	extended	our	previous	
environmental	finance	goal	from	$250	
billion	by	2025	to	$500	billion	by	2030.	
Through	this	commitment,	we	will	finance	
and	facilitate	a	wide	array	of	climate	
solutions,	such	as	renewable	energy,	
clean	technology,	water	conservation	and	
sustainable	transportation.	We	have	also	
committed	$500	billion	toward	activities	
in	social	finance,	which	includes	important	
investments	in	education,	affordable	
housing	and	basic	infrastructure,	health-
care,	economic	inclusion	and	food	security.	
Together,	these	$500	billion	targets	for	
environmental	and	social	finance	make	
up	our	$1	trillion	commitment,	which	aims	
to	further	accelerate	the	transition	to	a	
sustainable,	low-carbon	economy	that	
supports	societyâ€™s	environmental,	social	
and	economic	needs.
