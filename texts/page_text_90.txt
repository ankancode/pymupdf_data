Inclusion
Inclusive	practices	and	policies	lead	to	
improved	business	performance	and	a	
company	culture	where	employees	feel	
welcome,	safe	and	respected,	and	where	
they	can	focus	on	their	work	without	fear	
of	prejudice	or	discrimination.	We	work	
hard	to	establish	a	strong	DEI	foundation	
for	the	company	at	all	levels,	creating	
paths	for	the	next	generation	of	leaders	
across	every	dimension	of	diversity.
We	want	all	of	our	colleagues	to	feel	
empowered	to	share	all	aspects	of	their	
identity	so	that	we	may	continue	to	honor	
what	makes	them	diverse	and	unique	while	
also	strengthening	a	culture	that	values	
and	promotes	diverse	perspectives.	
Core	to	our	data-driven	approach	is	
gaining	better	understanding	of	how	
our	employees	self-identify	so	that	we	
can	better	meet	their	needs.	In	2021	
we	launched	a	global	Self-ID	campaign	
to	nearly	190,000	employees	(90%	
of	our	workforce),	who	were	invited	to	
self-identify	their	race	and	ethnicity,	
gender	identities,	sexual	orientation,	
disability	status	and	military	status,	as	
permissible	by	local	laws	and	regulations	
in	the	46	countries	we	survey.	For	2021,	
we	expanded	the	sexual	orientation	
dimension	from	15	to	34	countries	and	the	
race	and	ethnicity	dimension	from	18	to	
31	countries.	Additionally,	we	continued	to	
encourage	the	reporting	of	multiple	races/
ethnicities	for	those	employees	who	self-
identify	as	such	by	enabling	the	selection	
of	specific	races/ethnicities.	We	achieved	
a	response	rate	of	nearly	100%	for	global	
gender	and	U.S.	race/ethnicity.
See	our	employment	data	for	more	infor-
mation	about	our	workforce	composition.
