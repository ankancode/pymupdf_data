These 17 interrelated Sustainable Development Goals represent an 
ambitious agenda to achieve a sustainable future by 2030. Some examples 
of our work to advance specific SDGs can be found throughout this report.
Citi	and	the	Sustainable		
Development	Goals
Our sustainable finance 
commitment of $1 trillion by 2030 
aligns with the ambitious agenda 
of the UN SDGs by furthering the 
acceleration to a sustainable, 
low-carbon economy that supports 
the environmental, social and 
economic needs of society. 
As	the	world’s	most	global	bank,	Citi	has	a	
role	to	play	in	mobilizing	capital	to	advance	
progress	toward	the	goals.	
Citi	is	part	of	the	Global	Investors	for	
Sustainable	Development	(GISD)	Alliance,	
which	includes	30	of	the	world’s	largest	
investors	committed	to	accelerating	the	
financing	of	the	SDGs.	The	30	members		
	
	
have	committed	to	increase	our	collective	
efforts	to	align	our	businesses	with	the	
goals	and	to	remove	barriers	to	finance.	
Since	2010,	Citi	has	also	been	a	member	
of	the	UN	Global	Compact	(UNGC),	a	
global	corporate	sustainability	initiative	
to	align	companies’	strategies	and	oper-
ations	with	principles	on	human	rights,	
labor,	environment	and	anti-corruption,	
and	take	actions	that	advance	societal	
goals.	We	report	on	our	progress	to	
implement	the	10	UNGC	principles.
