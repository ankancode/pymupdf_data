Salient Human Rights Risks: Stakeholder Impacts
This table illustrates which stakeholders could be impacted by the human rights risks we have identified as most salient 
to our company. Rows shaded in gray indicate risks related to the Areas of High Caution defined in our ESRM Policy and 
trigger additional due diligence for project transactions, general corporate purpose transactions and regular reviews of 
client relationships. Additional context about our approach to mitigate these risks and related due diligence processes 
can be found throughout this report, in our Statement on Human Rights and in our Environmental and Social Policy 
Framework.
