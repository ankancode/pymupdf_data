Our Proxy Statement contains a summary of each named executive officer’s financial and

Committee. We seek to design our executive pay program to motivate balanced behaviors consistent 
with our focus on long-term strategic goals. For example, diversity and inclusion, including 
representation of women and U.S. Black colleagues at the Assistant Vice President to Managing 
Director levels, and ethics and culture are incorporated into senior executives’ scorecards, which are 
a factor in remuneration.
